- fixed a bug in IntegrationTest#verifyThatTheReportsAreCreated (the wrong file object was verified)
- Made protected methods in LogicDocTest public / also fixed testcases to reflect that change.

  also in scenarios, where we are already exending another testlibrary. In such scenarios we can now
  use DocTest as simple class level utitily class.
